# Optionals

### What are optionals in typescript?

Optional Properties are those properties that are not mandatory. Applications work fine with or without them.

### How to Use Optionals?

To make a specific property optional just add a question mark (?) after the property name. Any property type can be declared optional from strings, numbers, object field to callback functions.
