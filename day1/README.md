# What is typescript?

TypeScript is a free and open source high-level programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. As it is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

# Features of typescript.

TypeScript is a language extension that adds features to ECMAScript 6. Additional features include:

- Type annotations and compile-time type checking
- Type inference
- Type erasure
- Interfaces
- Enumerated types
- Generics
- Namespaces
- Tuples
- Async/await
- Function overloading
  The following features are backported from ECMAScript 2015:

- Classes
- Modules
- Abbreviated "arrow" syntax for anonymous functions
- Optional parameters and default parameters

# why should I use typescript?

JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

**TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.**
